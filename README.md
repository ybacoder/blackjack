# Blackjack Assignment Outline
The blackjack program is an optional assignment that can be used to replace any grade if it is well-done, and it runs. It must be completed using only the Python standard library. (No 3rd party packages). It must use classes to implement the solution.  You can use inheritance between Player and Dealer (with Dealer inheriting from Player). This assignment will require some research on classes, particularly inheritance. We hope you take a stab at this either way. It’s a classic programming problem and it’s a great way to learn about classes, which are central to Object-oriented programming. Have fun!
